Repo containing blog demo materials for profiling Triton GPU kernels

=======
## Triton Profiling

Triton profiling introduction demo materials and runtime container images.

### Requirements

- Fedora (tested on 42 KDE and Workstation)
- make
- podman

### Images

Container images that provide a runtime environment for either a host with
an NVIDIA GPU or one without.

- cuda                  - Requires an NVIDIA GPU
- nsight                - Does not require an NVIDIA GPU

### Instructions

#### Build

##### With an NVIDIA GPU

```bash
make cuda-image
```

##### Without an NVIDIA GPU

```bash
make nsight-image
```

#### Runtime

All targets will start a new container and remove it when you exit.

##### Console

Runs the target image and leaves the user inside it at a bash prompt.

```bash
make [cuda | nsight]-console
```

##### Jupyter Notebook

The nsight image can only be used to view the Jupyter notebook,
an NVIDIA GPU and the cuda image are required to run it.

```bash
make [cuda | nsight]-jupyter
```

##### Nsight Systems

Runs the Nsight Systems UI.

```bash
make [cuda | nsight]-systems
```

##### Nsight Compute

Runs the Nsight Compute UI.

```bash
make [cuda | nsight]-compute
```
